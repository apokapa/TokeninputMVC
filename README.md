jQuery Tokeninput MVC5 binding and prepopulate selected values ? No problem !

Do you need a token input control for your MVC form but havent found an answer of how to implement it on MVC yet ? 
This amazing plugin https://github.com/loopj/jquery-tokeninput/releases/tag/v1.7.0  is propably what you need and you propably already know it , but how to bind it in MVC5 and how to prepopulate the selected values after your form is posted. 
I hope my simple demonstration will help people that came up to this post through some desperate(?) google search find out how.
